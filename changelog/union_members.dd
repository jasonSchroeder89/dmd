Postblit and destructors are no longer called on members of anonymous unions.

Due to a bug in dmd, members of anonymous `unions` inside `struct` declarations
had their postblits/destructors called when an object of the containing
`struct` type was copied/destroyed. With this release, the postblit/destructor
is no longer called in such situations.
