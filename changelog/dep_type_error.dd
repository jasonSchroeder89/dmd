Usage of `this` and `super` as types is obsolete

Prior to this release, `this` and `super` could be used as both data or types depending on the context, but
was deprecated about a year ago. Starting with this release using `this` or `super` as a type will result in a compiler error.

class C
{
    shared(this) x;    // Error: Using `this` as a type is obsolete. Use `typeof(this)` instead
}

class D : C
{
    shared(super) a;   // Error: Using `super` as a type is obsolete. Use `typeof(super)` instead
    super b;           // Error: Using `super` as a type is obsolete. Use `typeof(super)` instead
}

Use typeof(super) or typeof(this) instead.

class C
{
    shared(typeof(this)) x;
}

class D : C
{
    shared(typeof(super)) a;
    typeof(super) b;
}
