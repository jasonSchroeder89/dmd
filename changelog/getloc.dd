add `__traits(getLocation, symbol)`

Takes one argument which is a symbol. Returns a `tuple(string, int, int)` whose entries correspond to the filename, line number and column number where the argument
was declared.

To disambiguate between overloads, pass the result of getOverloads with the desired index, to getLocation:
---
module m;
int foo();
int foo(int);
enum loc = __traits(getLocation, __traits(getOverloads, m, "foo")[0]);
---
