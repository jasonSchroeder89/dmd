Windows: The mingw based runtime and platform import libraries can now be selected explicitly

When specifying `-mscrtlib=msvcrt100` explicitly on the command line to dmd, detection
of a Visual Studio installation is skipped and the redistributable
VC2010 dynamic runtime library and mingw based platform import libraries will be used
unconditionally. The LLD linker (provided by the LLVM project) will be invoked
instead of the Microsoft linker.
