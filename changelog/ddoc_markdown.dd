Add Markdown-inspired features to Ddoc

With the `-preview=markdown` flag to dmd, Ddoc now supports $(LINK2 https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax, Markdown) features like headings, emphasized text, links and more. The full list of features is described in $(LINK2 https://dlang.org/spec/ddoc.html#highlighting, the Ddoc documentation page).

Use the `-transition=vmarkdown` flag together with the `-preview=markdown` flag to log all instances of Markdown features as they're processed in your documentation.
